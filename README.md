# LinkUp (Frontend)

This repo contains the frontend files for the LinkUp web app ‚Äî the client-side application that enables people to communicate through real-time and threaded chats. The frontend implements the UI, client-side routing, and integrates with backend APIs for authentication, chat, and user profiles.

## üîñ Project Title & Description

LinkUp ‚Äî Frontend

This is the frontend repo for the LinkUp web app ‚Äî a web application that enables people to communicate through real-time and threaded chats. The frontend focuses on fast, responsive UI and clear user flows for signing up, authenticating, creating/joining conversations, and viewing profiles.

Key responsibilities of this repo:

- UI components and layout

- Client-side routing and state management

- Calls to backend APIs for auth, messages, and profiles

- Integration with real-time transports (WebSocket or similar)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui

Notes:

- The project uses modern React patterns and a component-driven approach. See the `src/` directory for components and pages.

## üß† AI Integration Strategy

This project will use AI tools throughout development to accelerate scaffolding, improve test coverage, maintain documentation, and provide context-aware code suggestions. Below are concrete plans and examples for how AI will be used:

- Code generation
  - An IDE or CLI-based AI agent will scaffold new features (components, pages, routes, hooks) from a short feature spec. Example workflow:
    1. Developer writes a one-paragraph feature spec (UI, data shape, endpoints).
    2. The AI agent generates the component files, sample props, and a basic Tailwind layout.
    3. The agent creates a focused PR with the component, a usage example, and a short test file.
  - Keep generated code reviewable: always require a human review and add clear comments where AI made assumptions.

- Testing
  - Use AI to generate unit and integration tests from component props, example inputs, and API contracts.
  - Examples: write Jest + React Testing Library tests for component behavior, and small e2e test seeds for critical flows (login, send message, view profile).
  - Suggested prompts: "Given this component file and prop types, produce Jest + RTL tests covering render, user events, and edge cases."

- Documentation
  - Use AI to maintain docstrings, inline comments, and the `README.md`. Whenever a component or function is added or changed, generate or update concise JSDoc-style comments and a short usage example.
  - Keep a changelog-style summary in PR descriptions created by the AI agent to make human review faster.

- Context-aware techniques
  - Supply the AI agent with the project file tree, relevant API specs (OpenAPI/Swagger or a short description), and diffs/PRs so suggestions are aware of project constraints.
  - Examples of inputs to the AI agent:
    - The `src/` file tree snapshot for local context.
    - API endpoint summaries (path, method, request/response shapes) when generating code that calls the backend.
    - Git diffs or the current branch changes to generate targeted fixes/tests for the changed files.
  - Keep the AI context window focused: for large tasks, provide only the smallest necessary set of files (component file + related utils + API contract) to reduce noise and increase accuracy.

Security and process notes:

- Never include secrets, API keys, or private tokens when sending context to AI services.

- Always review and run linters/tests on AI-generated code before merging.

Note: See project files in the repository for context and file contents; you may not need to re-open files unless you want to provide them to an AI tool.
